Using a presigned URL for file upload instead of directly passing files to a Lambda function for upload offers several advantages, especially in the context of AWS services and serverless architectures:

Security:

Least Privilege Principle: With a presigned URL, you can generate a URL that grants temporary access only to specific operations (like upload) on a specific object in an S3 bucket. This adheres to the principle of least privilege, reducing the risk of unintended access or exposure.
No Lambda Permissions Needed: Since the file is uploaded directly to S3 via the presigned URL, the Lambda function doesnâ€™t need additional permissions to perform the upload operation, reducing the attack surface.
Scalability:

Direct Upload to S3: Presigned URLs allow clients (like your React frontend) to directly upload files to S3 without routing through Lambda. This offloads the upload workload from Lambda, enabling it to focus on business logic or other tasks, enhancing scalability and performance.
Performance:

Faster Uploads: Direct uploads via presigned URLs can be faster because they eliminate the extra network hop and processing time required to pass files through a Lambda function.
Cost Efficiency:

Reduced Lambda Execution Time: By using presigned URLs for direct uploads, you reduce the amount of compute resources (and associated costs) used by Lambda for handling file uploads.
Simplicity and Flexibility:

Client-Side Control: Presigned URLs allow your client application (React frontend) to have more control over the upload process. You can customize headers, timeouts, and other parameters directly from the client side, without needing to modify Lambda function code.
How It Works in Practice
Generating Presigned URLs: Your backend (could be a Lambda function or another server-side component) generates presigned URLs using AWS SDKs. These URLs include the necessary authentication and authorization details for a specified time period.

Client-Side Upload: Your React frontend receives this presigned URL and uses it in conjunction with the FormData API to upload files directly to S3. This involves making an HTTP PUT or POST request to the presigned URL with the file payload.

Security and Validation: AWS validates the request against the presigned URL parameters (like expiry time and signature), ensuring that only authorized uploads are accepted.

Example Use Case
In your scenario, using presigned URLs for file upload from a React frontend ensures secure and efficient file handling:

Scenario: Uploading user-generated files to an S3 bucket.
Implementation: Your Lambda function generates presigned URLs dynamically for each upload request.
Advantages: Simplified architecture, reduced Lambda execution time and costs, and enhanced security through temporary, scoped access.
By leveraging presigned URLs, you optimize the upload process for performance, security, and cost-effectiveness, making it a robust choice in many serverless and AWS-centric applications.
